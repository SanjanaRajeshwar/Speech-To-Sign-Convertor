# E2SL-English-to-Indian-Sign-Language-Convertor
Sign language is the primary means of communication for the deaf community, but not everyone is proficient in this language. This can lead to communication barriers and exclusion of the deaf community from important conversations and events. The text or speech to sign language converter is an innovative tool/ software that aims to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and deaf communities. Many such convertors already exist most of them are for American or British sign language. Sign languages are different for every country. Since Indian sign language is still in its infancy stage, there aren’t many convertors for Indian sign language. Limited database and low accuracy are some common drawbacks of the convertors that exist. So, our project, E2SL proposes an accurate and efficient web-based application for converting text and audio input into Indian Sign Language (ISL) using JavaScript Web API and natural language processing (NLP). The approach uses JavaScript Web API for speech to text conversion which is proven to be highly accurate and then extracts ISL relevant keywords from the text through Natural Language Processing techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, stop word removal, etc. The keywords are then matched with the animations present in database and consequently displayed to the user.
# Implementation Details
Framework: Python Django <br />
Database: SQLite <br />
Coding Environment: VS Code <br />
Data collection: The first step is to collect a dataset of spoken English and its corresponding ISL translation. We collected data from https://indiansignlanguage.org/ . <br /> Each animation is stored in the database by their English name. <br />
Speech recognition: The speech recognition API is used to transcribe the spoken English into text. This involves sending the recorded speech to the API and receiving the corresponding text output. We are using JavaScript Web to Speech API for Speech recognition. <br />
Pre-processing: The text output from the speech recognition API must be pre-processed as per ISL rules before being sent for translation. This may involve cleaning the data, and performing text processing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal and lemmatization using the NLTK library of python. <br />
Translation: The keywords from pre-processing are then matched with the animation names in the database and all matching animations are merged. <br />
Sign language output: The resulting ISL output is then displayed on the screen or communicated through a sign language avatar. <br />
